        // IDEAS: possibly just set up one gig and have a bunch of choices that follow each option and eventually get into the actual playing of the song and have choices what you do there, maybe even regarding what chord it is and what scale you play over it, and just one successive story line that unfolds differently and maybe you have an 'ambission health meter, or confidence meter or something like that 
        
        //details: 'Youve been practicing your instrument for sometime now but this is the first time youll be on the stage.  Not to mention theres some pretty heavy hitters also playing tonight in the jam-session.  Your sweating pretty good and nervous not to make a wrong move and get a bad rep. //'
